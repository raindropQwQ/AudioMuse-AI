"""App-layer helpers that compose the data (``database``) and queue
(``taskqueue``) layers for the web and task tiers.

This is NOT the database layer -- all SQL lives in ``database.py``. What remains
here is orchestration and presentation glue:

- ``cancel_job_and_children_recursive`` -- recursively cancel an RQ job tree.
- ``build_and_store_map_projection`` / ``build_and_store_artist_projection`` --
  compute a 2D projection and persist it via ``database``.
- ``attach_song_features`` / ``top_stratified_genre`` -- enrich API result rows.

It also re-exports the most commonly used ``database`` / ``taskqueue`` handles so
the many modules doing ``from app_helper import get_db, redis_conn, ...`` are
untouched.
