"""Shared logging setup for every AudioMuse-AI entry point.

Call ``configure_logging()`` exactly once per process, as early as possible —
before any module that emits log records gets imported. ``logging.basicConfig``
is a no-op if the root logger already has a handler, so calling this helper
multiple times across imports is safe.

Why this exists: workers that don't import ``app`` (the high-priority worker,
the janitor) used to set up logging inline, with formats that drifted from
``app.py``. When one of them forgot to call ``basicConfig`` at all, every
``logger.info(...)`` from task modules fell through to Python's ``lastResort``
handler — silently dropping INFO-level output during long-running jobs.

Record sanitization: the ``LogSanitizingFilter`` cleans every log record before
it reaches a handler. It removes emoji / non-Latin-1 symbols (which raise
``UnicodeEncodeError`` / ``UnicodeDecodeError`` on Windows when stdout is a pipe
or the console code-page cannot represent the character) and neutralizes CR/LF
and other control characters so an attacker-controlled value embedded in a
message cannot forge or split log lines (CWE-117, log injection). This is the
single, centralized place where log-message sanitization happens — call sites
log the raw value and the filter cleans it. HTML templates and web-UI progress
messages are unaffected — only the Python ``logging`` pipeline is sanitised, and
the traceback ``logger.exception`` appends is left intact (the formatter renders
it after filtering, so the full error is always visible in the log).
