# Configuration Parameters

These are the parameters accepted for this script. From `v1.0.0`, only PostgreSQL, Redis, and `TZ` configuration must still be configured via environment variables. All other configuration values are managed through the browser setup wizard and persisted in the database. For compatibility with legacy installations, environment variables are imported into the database automatically on first startup. The Setup Wizard is shown on clean installation as lending page and is also available later from the menu under Administration > Setup Wizard.

How to find jellyfin **userid**:
* Log into Jellyfin from your browser as an admin
* Go to Dashboard > “admin panel” > Users.
* Click on the user’s name that you are interested
* The User ID is visible in the URL (is the part just after = ):
  * http://your-jellyfin-server/web/index.html#!/useredit.html?userId=xxxxx

How to create an the **jellyfin's API token**:
* The API Token, still as admin you can go to Dashboard > “Admin panel” > API Key and create a new one.

| `LYRICS_API_1_APIKEY_PARAM`                 | Query parameter name for the API key in slot 1 (leave empty if no key needed).            | `""`                                   |
| `LYRICS_API_1_APIKEY_VALUE`                 | API key value for slot 1.                                                                  | `""`                                   |
| `LYRICS_API_1_TIMEOUT`                      | HTTP timeout in seconds for API slot 1.                                                    | `5.0`                                  |
| `LYRICS_API_2_URL_TEMPLATE`                 | URL template for lyrics API slot 2 (fallback after slot 1).                               | `""`                                   |
| `LYRICS_API_2_ARTIST_PARAM`                 | Query parameter name for the artist in API slot 2.                                        | `artist`                               |
| `LYRICS_API_2_TITLE_PARAM`                  | Query parameter name for the track title in API slot 2.                                   | `title`                                |
| `LYRICS_API_2_LYRICS_FIELD`                 | JSON field name containing the lyrics text in the API slot 2 response.                    | `lyrics`                               |
| `LYRICS_API_2_APIKEY_PARAM`                 | Query parameter name for the API key in slot 2.                                            | `""`                                   |
| `LYRICS_API_2_APIKEY_VALUE`                 | API key value for slot 2.                                                                  | `""`                                   |
| `LYRICS_API_2_TIMEOUT`                      | HTTP timeout in seconds for API slot 2.                                                    | `5.0`                                  |
| `VAD_VOICE_RECOGNITION`                     | Minimum seconds of voiced audio Silero VAD must detect before a track is sent to the Whisper-small ASR engine for lyric transcription. Tracks below this threshold are treated as instrumental/ambient and skip ASR entirely (the instrumental embedding sentinel is used instead). Use this knob to fine-tune instrumental/ambient song recognition in the lyrics analysis pipeline. Setting it very high (e.g. `1000`) effectively disables ASR transcription for every track, since no song can reach that much voiced audio within the 4-minute analysis clip. | `25` |
| `LYRICS_ASR_BEAM_SIZE`                      | Beam search width for the Whisper-small ASR decoder. 1 = pure greedy (fastest, most error-prone), 2 = sweet spot (catches stuck-loop attractors at ~2× greedy cost), 5 = Whisper-upstream default (max quality, ~5× cost). Each extra beam adds one extra decoder.run per generated token plus its own KV cache (~30-80 MB at a full 30 s chunk). | `5` |
| `LYRICS_ASR_MIN_AVG_LOGPROB`                | General avg_logprob floor for ASR output. Whisper-small's per-chunk avg_logprob is averaged over the track; if the result is below this threshold the transcript is dropped as likely hallucination and the track is treated as instrumental. Values are negative — closer to `0` is stricter (rejects more), more negative is looser (accepts more). `-1.0` is a permissive global floor that catches only truly degenerate transcriptions. | `-1.0` |
| `LYRICS_ASR_NON_ENGLISH_MIN_LOGPROB`        | Additional avg_logprob floor applied only when Whisper reports a non-English language. Whisper-small is English-biased, so legitimate non-English transcriptions (CJK, Cyrillic, Arabic, etc.) naturally score lower in the `-0.5` to `-0.8` range; set this looser than the English floor (more negative) to avoid dropping valid foreign-language lyrics. Raise toward `-0.5` if you see garbage non-English transcriptions slipping through. | `-0.85` |
| `LYRICS_WHISPER_MODEL_DIR`                  | Path to the Whisper-small ONNX bundle directory. Must contain `encoder_model.onnx`, `decoder_model_merged.onnx`, `tokenizer.json` and the rest of the HuggingFace optimum export. Pre-bundled in the official Docker image from `lyrics_model_whisper.tar.gz`. | `/app/model/whisper-small-onnx` |
| `LYRICS_WHISPER_LANG_CONFIDENCE`            | Confidence floor for Whisper's built-in language detection (softmax over the 99 language tokens at the first decoder step). Chunks whose top-language probability falls below this are dropped and the track is treated as instrumental — no external langdetect involved. Lower to 0.5 if you find legit songs being dropped. | `0.7` |
| `LYRICS_WHISPER_MIN_FREE_RAM_GB`            | Minimum free RAM (GB) before Whisper loads. Whisper-small peaks ~1.5 GB, so 2.5 GB leaves headroom. | `2.5` |
| `LYRICS_TEXT_MAX_COMPRESSION_RATIO`         | Compression ratio (zlib) used to filter out text that is not real lyrics. Highly repetitive content compresses far more than real lyrics, so text above this ratio is dropped before embedding. Set to `0` to disable the gate. | `15.0` |
| `SEM_GROVE_WEIGHT_LYRICS`                   | Contribution of the lyrics embedding to the merged SemGrove cosine similarity (squared scale factor, [0.0–1.0]). Requires index rebuild after change. | `0.75` |
| `SEM_GROVE_WEIGHT_AUDIO`                    | Contribution of the MusicNN audio embedding to the merged SemGrove cosine similarity (squared scale factor, [0.0–1.0]). Requires index rebuild after change. | `0.25` |


> ⚠️ **The only officially supported model is `qwen3.5:9b` or `qwen3.5:4b` for faster one**. Compatibility testing is done exclusively against it. Other models below were tested and may work, but **use them at your own risk** — issues opened for untested or arbitrary models could be closed. Different models behave differently and outputs vary between runs.

> ℹ️ **The models listed below were tested in the past and will not be retested going forward.** They are documented for reference only.

**Self-hosted (Ollama):** `gemma3:4b`, `ministral-3:3b` (fastest), plus: llama3.1:8b, llama3.2:1b/3b, gemma3:1b, qwen3:0.6b/1.7b, qwen2.5:1.5b, qwen3.5:0.8b/2b, deepseek-r1:1.5b, phi4-mini:3.8b, lfm2.5-thinking:1.2b.

**Cloud, tested March 2026:** `claude-sonnet-4.6` (best), `claude-haiku-4.5`, `gemini-3-flash-preview`. Earlier: mistral:7b, llama3.1:8b, gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-1.5-flash-latest.

## OpenAI-compatible hosted providers

AudioMuse-AI can use hosted services that expose an OpenAI-compatible chat completions API through the existing `OPENAI` provider. [Atlas Cloud](https://www.atlascloud.ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=AudioMuse-AI) is one example: point `OPENAI_SERVER_URL` at its OpenAI-compatible endpoint and keep using a model that has been validated for AudioMuse-AI unless you have tested another model with your library.

Example Atlas Cloud configuration:

```env
AI_MODEL_PROVIDER=OPENAI
OPENAI_SERVER_URL=https://api.atlascloud.ai/v1/chat/completions
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=qwen3.5:9b
OPENAI_API_KEY=<atlas-key>
```
