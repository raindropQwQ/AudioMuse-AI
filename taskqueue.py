"""Centralized task-queue / Redis access, dispatched on ``config.QUEUE_TYPE``.

Companion to :mod:`database`, in the same spirit as ``tasks/mediaserver.py``: one
module owns the Redis connection and the two RQ queues so the rest of the code
never builds them itself. ``app_helper`` re-exports the handles below, so every
module that does ``from app_helper import redis_conn, rq_queue_high`` is untouched.

``redis`` (default) and ``embedded`` both talk to a *real* Redis via
``config.REDIS_URL`` -- RQ relies on Lua ``EVAL``, pub/sub and job registries, so a
genuine server is required. The only difference is who starts it: with ``embedded``
the macOS supervisor launches the bundled ``redis-server`` binary (see
:func:`build_embedded_redis_argv`) and exports its socket URL as ``REDIS_URL``
before the app and workers boot.

``rq`` hardcodes ``UnixSignalDeathPenalty`` as every job registry's default, so
on Windows (no ``signal.SIGALRM``) registry cleanup -- the janitor loop and the
workers' periodic maintenance -- raises ``AttributeError`` whenever an abandoned
job carries an ``on_failure`` callback, and the job is never removed.
``BaseRegistry`` is therefore re-pointed at RQ's own platform dispatcher and
the queues below are built with the same class: a no-op on POSIX, the
timer-based penalty (what RQ's workers already use) on Windows.
