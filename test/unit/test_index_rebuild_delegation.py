"""Source-level guard that the post-task index rebuild delegates to the single
shared orchestrator (``tasks.analysis._run_all_index_builds``) rather than the
old partial rebuild path.

History this pins:

* ``collection_manager.sync_collections_task`` used to rebuild ONLY the audio
  Voyager index after a sync, leaving CLAP / lyrics / lyrics-axes / SemGrove /
  artist and the 2D map projections stale until the next analysis run.
* ``cleaning.identify_and_clean_orphaned_albums_task`` rebuilt a hand-maintained
  subset of builders inline, in three separate branches.

Both now route through ``_run_all_index_builds``, which builds the full set in
the same order as the analysis task and publishes the reload message. The
runtime behaviour of the orchestrator itself is covered by
``test_index_rebuild_integration.py``; this file only locks in the delegation
contract so a future edit cannot silently revert either task to a partial
rebuild.

These tests parse the source with ``ast`` -- no import of the task modules, no
DB, no voyager/sklearn/librosa -- so they run in every environment and never
skip.
