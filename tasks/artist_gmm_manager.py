"""
Artist Similarity using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Voyager Index.

This module implements artist similarity by:
1. Using existing embedding vectors (same as song similarity) for all tracks per artist
2. Fitting a GMM to the embedding vectors to represent each artist's "sound profile"
3. Building a Voyager index for fast approximate nearest neighbor search
4. Using Jeffreys Divergence (symmetric KL divergence) to measure GMM similarity

This approach is fast (no audio re-processing) and consistent with the song similarity system.
